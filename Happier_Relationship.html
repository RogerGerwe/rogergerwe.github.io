Solution Focused therapy is directed toward what a person or couple would like to achieve from therapy. It helps people move from a negative view of their troubles or mental health issues toward a positive or healthier solution. As a Solution focused therapist we help our clients envision a desirable future, and then plan and achieve small and large changes needed to accomplish their goals. As a Solution Focused therapist we support and encourage small and large successes our client experiences and encourage them to build on their strengths while discouraging focus on their problems.</em></div></div>

<div><strong>&nbsp;EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization &amp; Reprocessing)</strong> We are specially trained to provide EMDR as a tool for rapid improvement of past traumatic and abusive events. EMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. EMDR is an information processing therapy that helps clients resolve and better cope with past trauma, addictions, phobias and losses. During treatment the client focuses on a specific image and associated negative thought and physical sensation while simultaneously listening to bilateral sounds or watching the therapist's finger move bilaterally in front of their eyes. After the negative images and emotions are reprocessed the client is asked to focus on their desired thoughts of the event, while again simultaneously focusing on the bilateral movement. As a trained EMDR therapist we oversee and observe the process of our clients brains changing negative and disturbing memories and almost naturally reprocessed with more acceptable, truthful or positive one.</div></div>

Cognitive Behavioral therapy focuses on how we think, how we feel and what we do. Cognitive Behavioral therapy is based on the idea that our clients thoughts, rather than people or events, cause our negative feelings about these people or events. We assist our client in identifying dysfunctional beliefs, testing the reality of these beliefs, and correcting our dysfunctional beliefs impacting our clients thinking. As a Cognitive Behavioral therapist we assist our client in changing these thoughts and the resultant behaviors that flow from those negative thoughts. As a Cognitive Behavioral therapist develop a collaborative intervention between the CBT therapist and our client that often includes homework assignments to be completed between sessions. CBT has been clinically proven to assist client improvement in a relatively short period of time with a wide variety of issues and problems, including anxiety and depression.</em></div>

As a Family Systems therapist we look specifically at the dynamics of the family to try to understand their functioning and problems. We view the family members as part of a complex system with their own patterns, language, rules, roles, beliefs and particular needs. As Family Systems therapists we help the individual members understand how their own childhood family operated, the impact of that role in that system, their family rules and expectations, and how that experience has shaped their role in their current family and its functioning.</div></div>

Together, we will make your counseling experience best fit your personal needs. We can meet weekly, bi-weekly or monthly, depending on your scheduled and level of need. We will set specific goals to ensure that you are making therapeutic gains in our work together.</span><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">&nbsp;I'm  genuine and have positive regard for you. I immediately work on building a solid relationship with you and helping you learn new and healthier solutions to your problems and concerns. </span><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">&nbsp;Call me and let me assist you in a healthier, happier and more satisfactory life today.</span></p><p>I am a social worker in private practice in Cincinnati for the past 20 years. I specialize and have extensive experience in the healing of relational, marriage and family problems, as well as addictions of all sorts, and post trauma and past child abuse treatment. I have been independently licensed as a social worker and addiction counselor for the past 20 years. I have several &nbsp;years of &nbsp;post graduate family therapy training at the Family Therapy Center in Cincinnati under the renowned family therapist, Betty Gillman. My training and experience also includes memory reconsolidation techniques such as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing or EMDR for short. I'm also a "Give an Hour" clinician offering free services for returning post 911 American veterans and their families.</p></div>
